Pulls stock info from yFinance


Only the scraper works right now.  Remember to change the filepath info in the code.
  Takes some stocks as input and retrieves Options info from the web.  Then calculates the most profitable strike price and outputs the info into the terminal.
  
  The other programs are still work in progress.  Want to eventually make a ui with user input for stock names.
